Exercises I did for Codédex's SQL basic course

### What is Codédex SQL course?
It's a beginner course on SQL offered by Codédex. See course [here](https://www.codedex.io/sql/)!

### What's in this repository?
These are SQL files of the exercises I did during the course.

Each file is named **## - xxx.sql** where **##** is the *exercise number* and **xxx** is the *exercise name*. If you visit Codédex, you can easily identify which exercises these files correspond to.

So far, I have done the following modules in the course:
| Module  | Exercises |
| --- | --- |
| Queries  | 01 to 08  |
| Aggregates  | 09 to 15  |

### Is that all?
Nope. Lessons are ongoing so I'll be putting more exercises here as I finish them.
